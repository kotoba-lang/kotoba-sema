  "Is this vector binding used LINEARLY — at most once on every path, with a
  consuming update as its last use?

  ## Why the question is worth asking

  `vector-assoc` allocates. The native host says so in its own words: *every
  operation that changes an element allocates rather than mutates*, and
  `checked_vector_assoc` is a `memmove` of the whole vector followed by a bump
  into an arena that is never reclaimed. Two consequences, both measured
  rather than reasoned about:

  - one element write costs O(length)
  - the number of writes a vector may ever receive is
    `arena / length` — **a 16,384-item vector, the longest KIR admits, can be
    updated four times in the life of a program** (65,536 / 16,384)

  An order book is a struct of arrays with about a million slots per field and
  a write on every order. Both numbers are wrong for it by orders of
  magnitude, and neither is a safety property: `surface-status.edn` classifies
  the whole native vector entry `:implemented-partial`, and its `:state` entry
  says plainly that **the invariant is AMBIENT, not mutation itself**.

  ## What linearity buys, and why it is not a new semantics

  If a vector handle is dead after an update, updating it in place and
  allocating a copy are indistinguishable to every observer. So this analysis
  does not change what a program MEANS. It decides when the backend may lower
  `vector-assoc` to a store instead of a copy, which is why the answer has to
  be conservative: a wrong `true` here silently mutates a value somebody still
  holds.

  ## What conservative means here

  `false` for anything not obviously linear. The shapes admitted are the ones
  a struct-of-arrays actually writes:

      (let [v (vector-i64-new n)
            v (vector-assoc v 0 x)      ; shadows — the old v is dead
            v (vector-assoc v 1 y)]
        (vector-at v 0))

  A binding that is READ after being consumed, referenced twice on one path,
  returned, passed to a function, or captured is refused. Escape analysis for
  literals already exists next door in `kotoba.native.vector-region`; this is
  the same posture applied to the update path rather than to construction.

  ## Why it lives in the frontend

  It first landed in `kotoba-native`, next to `kotoba.native.vector-region`,
  which is a similar-looking escape analysis. Wrong home: this reads SOURCE,
  `kotoba-sema` is what holds source, and a backend repo is not on this one's
  dependency path -- so the gate could never have been consulted from where
  the decision is made."

  ALIASES the safe one."
