(ns kotoba.compiler.f32-literal-test
  "A decimal literal in an `:f32` context, which until now could not be written.

  Everything else about f32 was already here -- arity, operand typing, result
  typing, `:f32` in `value-types` and `closure-flat-result-types` and
  `schema.cljc`. The one missing piece was the literal, and its absence was not
  a missing feature so much as a contradiction: `contextual-f32-argument-indexes`
  desugars an f32 operand under an `:f32` expectation, but the literal branch
  ignored that expectation and produced `(f64-from-bits ...)`. So every f32
  operation rejected its own literal argument as the wrong type, and
  `(f32-add 1.5 2.5)` was unwritable.

  The rule is exact-or-refused. A decimal literal reaches this compiler as a
  host binary64 -- the reader has already rounded and the decimal text is gone
  -- so decimal -> binary32 cannot be done in one step, and
  decimal -> binary64 -> binary32 is not always the same value. Rather than make
  that silent, a literal is admitted only when the binary64 round-trips exactly
  through binary32.

  Decided by kotoba-lang docs/adr/ADR-kotoba-floating-point-on-native.md."
