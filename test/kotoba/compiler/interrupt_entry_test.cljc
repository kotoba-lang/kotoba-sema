  "Two rules an interrupt entry has to obey before any byte is emitted.

  ONE: `kernel-isr-entry-address` is admitted at arity 1 and nothing else.
  Arity is the WHOLE of what this frontend verifies for a privileged
  operation, and the number is stated independently in three repositories --
  here, in kotoba-gmir's `x86-privileged-action-arities`, and in
  kotoba-native's emitter -- with nothing keeping them equal but review.

  TWO: a function whose NAME claims an interrupt vector must have the
  signature the toolchain-generated entry calls. That entry is a fixed byte
  sequence: it loads four registers out of the frame the CPU built and calls.
  It cannot ask the body what it wanted, so a body of a different arity is
  handed four registers and reads whichever of them it happened to name -- a
  wrong answer with no diagnostic anywhere, which is why the refusal is here
  and not in the packager.

  What this namespace cannot check: whether the packager actually laid an
  entry down at that vector. That is kotoba-native's, and the two halves are
  deliberately separate -- this one is about the SOURCE naming a vector, that
  one about an IMAGE having one."
