  "Per-parameter type annotations, on both runtimes.

  Annotating one parameter used to force annotating every parameter in the
  vector, so a function taking one string among three counters wrote two `:i64`s
  that carried no information. That is a large share of the annotation churn in
  a `.cljc` port and none of it says anything -- an unannotated parameter has
  always meant `:i64`, before and after.

  What the relaxation must NOT do is change the meaning of a parameter. Two
  tests below exist for that alone: an unannotated parameter is still rejected
  where a string is required, and the three arguments of a mixed vector still
  arrive in the order they were written.

  The parsing hazard is that a vector can be either position -- `[a b]` is
  destructuring, `[:vector [:i64 :i64]]` is a type -- so the discriminator is
  the head, which is a keyword in every value type and a symbol in every
  pattern. `destructuring-pattern-is-not-read-as-a-type` is the case that
  separates that rule from `vector?`: with the looser test it fails."
