  "An unbound symbol is refused with the nearest defined names beside it.

  Measured while porting aiueos `os/aiueos/native/tcp_stream.kotoba`: a local
  `buffer-index` survived its rename to `buffer-idx`, and the refusal said
  `unbound or dynamic symbol is forbidden` -- not which symbol, and not that a
  name one edit away was in scope. One debugging round to find a typo the
  checker had already located.

  The candidates come from what the checker itself has in hand at the site:
  the locals in scope (parameters and let bindings) and the functions of the
  module. Nothing is invented -- no candidate is offered when nothing is near,
  and the list is bounded (three) and ordered by edit distance, then name, so
  the message is deterministic on both runtimes."
