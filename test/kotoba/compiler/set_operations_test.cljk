  "`conj` and `disj` were declared admitted heads with no desugar arm at all.

  `lang/guest-grammar.edn` has carried

    :conj {:desugars-to \"pair prepend after duplicate removal\" :level \"L2\"
           :backends #{:compiler :kotoba-wasm :kotoba-cljs}}
    :disj {:desugars-to \"bounded set removal\" :level \"L2\"
           :backends #{:compiler :kotoba-wasm :kotoba-cljs}}

  since the heads were declared, and `lang/surface-status.edn` `:set-literal`
  claims `:operations #{contains? conj disj}` on the same three backends.
  Measured 2026-09-03 against sema `1587f57` / amu `6c245f69`, BEFORE this
  change:

    (conj #{:a} :b)   operation has no admitted lowering
    (disj #{:a} :a)   operation has no admitted lowering

  -- the generic refusal for a head nothing rewrote, on every receiver. It is
  exactly the defect `contains?` and `dissoc` had until earlier the same day,
  and it is fixed the same way: `typed-set-conj` and `typed-set-disj` already
  existed, were already lowered on all three backends, and already returned
  the set type so they nest. Nothing was missing but the dispatch.

  What is pinned here:

  1. positives, run to a value on the KIR interpreter -- not merely admitted;
  2. the REASON each refusal is raised, by its stable code, so a program that
     fails for some other reason cannot be counted as this arm discriminating
     (ADR-2608136000 question 6);
  3. the receiver refusal in both directions, so the arm is known to say yes
     and no rather than only one of them;
  4. `#{...}` is `[:set :keyword]` and nothing else -- a heterogeneous literal
     is NOT admitted, and the refusal now says so rather than reporting a bare
     `expected keyword, got i64`."
