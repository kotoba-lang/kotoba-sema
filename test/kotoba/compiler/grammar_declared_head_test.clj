  "The third cause behind the old catch-all: a head the language grammar
  declares (`lang/guest-grammar.edn` -- `:admitted-builtins`, `:predicates`,
  `:sugar`, ...) that this analyser has no lowering for. `(min 1 2)`,
  `(string? x)` and `(alloc 8)` were all refused as `operation has no admitted
  lowering`, the same sentence a misspelling gets, so a reader could not tell
  a typo from a not-yet-implemented head. The grammar is a classpath resource
  the JVM reads synchronously; that is why this file is `.clj` -- on
  ClojureScript the same head answers as unknown, and the `.cljc` sibling
  documents that."
