  "The frontend's half of `kernel-dot-f32` (kotoba-gmir ADR 0010), and the one
  thing about it that is not inherited: it has TWO regions.

  Every other operation in `kernel-memory-operations` has its base in argument
  0, and the provenance walk was written as the literal `(first args)`. An
  operation with a second base would have had that base flow past the walk
  entirely -- an untraceable pointer in a position nothing looked at, which is
  exactly the hole `traceable-base?` exists to close, reopened for one
  operation. `kernel-base-positions` is the fix, and this namespace is what
  would fail if the walk went back to reading argument 0."
