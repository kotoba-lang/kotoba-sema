  "T4.5 map/filter source bindings keep `:vector-i64` through loop lowering.

  Measured against sema `a2f86f87`, before this change:

    (defn double-each [xs] (map (fn [x] (* x 2)) xs))
    (defn main [] (vector-at (double-each [3 4]) 1))

  was refused `expression type mismatch: expected vector-i64, got i64`
  naming `__kotoba_map_source_0_5` -- a binding the author never wrote --
  because the loop helper captured the rebound source as provisional `:i64`.
  The same cascade hit `(map f (rest xs))` (`pair-second` typed the tail
  as `:i64`) and stdlib.core's own `mapv`, whose recursive call was stolen
  by the vector alias and then refused the pair-chain tail.

  What is pinned here:

  1. an unannotated map/filter collection is refined to `:vector-i64` and
     the error form is the author's parameter, not the synthetic;
  2. `rest` / `pair-second` of a vector source stay `:vector-i64`;
  3. a module-defined `mapv` is not stolen (stdlib.core pair-chain walk);
  4. compiler `mapv` on a bounded vector still runs when the name is free;
  5. the unchanged integer `map` program still emits the same helper
     param-types the loop-accumulator suite already pinned."
