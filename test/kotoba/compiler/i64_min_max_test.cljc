  "The i64 `min`/`max` heads (paired with kotoba-kir's interpreter).

  spotwork (cloud-itonami) computes working-hour overlap and cohort ranking
  with min/max over i64 values. The f64 family already had `f64-min`/`f64-max`;
  i64 had neither a head nor a lowering (legacy spellings `min`/`max` existed
  only in guest-grammar's :admitted-builtins for the old WASM emitter). The
  KIR PR adds the interpreter case; this test pins the sema side: the heads
  are admitted as binary i64 operations and type-check to i64."
