  "An export that is not a public function is refused with the export named
  and the reason said: a `def` constant (with the one-line rewrite), a `defn-`
  private function, or a name the module never defines.

  `namespace exports must name declared public functions` was the whole
  message for all three. Measured while porting aiueos: a poll bound exported
  as a `def` cost one round to learn that exports are functions and another to
  learn the fix. The head of the sentence is kept so a reader who pinned it
  still matches."
