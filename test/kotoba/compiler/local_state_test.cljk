  "Local state, slice 1 (kotoba-lang `lang/local-state.edn`).

  `lang/surface-status.edn` `:no-ambient-mutation` bans `atom`/`swap!`/`reset!`
  under the invariant that state must not be AMBIENT -- not that mutation is
  forbidden. The `:state` capability kit is the admitted model for state that
  ESCAPES or PERSISTS. It is the wrong model for

      (let [a (atom 0)] (swap! a + 1) @a)

  which needs no host, no grant and no runtime cell. This is that second
  widening, in the smallest complete shape:

  - `(atom init)` is admitted ONLY as a let binding's init. The name it binds
    is a CELL, not a value: it may appear only as the first argument of
    `swap!` / `reset!` / `deref` (`@a`), in the same function body.
  - The elaboration is state passing. The cell becomes an ordinary let-bound
    value, rebound after every write; `deref` reads the current binding;
    `swap!`/`reset!` evaluate to the new value, as Clojure's do.
  - A branching form whose arms write is emitted once per mutated cell plus
    once for its own value, so the join is a rebinding rather than a merge.
  - Nothing reaches the effect row. `:named-operations` gains `:local-state`.

  Everything the slice does not do is refused with a message that says so, and
  each refusal is pinned here by its exact text. The control at the end is an
  atom-free program whose HIR and KIR hashes were taken on the commit before
  this pass existed (kotoba-sema 411d4cab): a change to how any atom-free
  program lowers would move them."
