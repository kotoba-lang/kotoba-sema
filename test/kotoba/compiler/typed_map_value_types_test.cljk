  "`[:map K V]` was generic in V everywhere except where a program could reach
  it -- the same defect the key half had, one layer over.

  Measured 2026-09-03 against sema df383ba0 / amu 57ba0ee0, at BOTH layers:

                    bare literal {1 <v>}      typed-map-new / get / assoc /
                                              dissoc / contains? / entry-at
    :i64            OK                        OK
    :string         type mismatch: expected   OK
                      i64, got string
    :bool           ... got bool              OK
    :keyword        ... got keyword           OK
    record          ... got [:record ...]     OK
    [:map :i64 :i64] ... got [:map :i64 :i64] OK
    [:vector [...]] ... got [:vector [...]]   OK
    [:set :i64]     ... got [:set :i64]       OK
    :f64            outside the structured    outside the structured scalar
                      scalar ABI                ABI

  Every column but the first was already generic. What refused an ordinary
  program was the LITERAL, which fixed its value type at `:i64` -- so

    (let [m {1 \"a\"}] (typed-map-count [:map :i64 :string] m))

  exited 65 with `expression type mismatch: expected i64, got string`: a
  GENERIC type error on a program that reads correct, and the same shape of
  defect the key work fixed the day before.

  The runtime never had the restriction. `kotoba.kir.value/bounded-typed-value!`
  validates a `[:map K V]` by validating each key against K and each value
  against V, then sorting the entries with `compare-typed-values` on the KEY
  ALONE, and detecting duplicates on the KEY ALONE. Measured:

    (bounded-typed-value! [:map :i64 :string]
                          [[:map :i64 :string] [[9 \"a\"] [2 \"z\"] [5 \"m\"]]])
    => [[2 \"z\"] [5 \"m\"] [9 \"a\"]]     ; ordered by key; the values rode along
    [[1 10] [1 99]]  => throws \"typed map contains a duplicate key\"

  so a VALUE needs neither a total order nor a decidable identity. That is why
  the float refusals are two different facts and are said as two messages: a
  floating KEY has no identity to be a key by, and a floating VALUE is refused
  by the structured scalar ABI alone (`validate-value-type!` throws \"direct
  floating map keys or values are outside the structured scalar ABI\" for
  `[:map :i64 :f64]`). The value-side obstacle is REAL -- it is not the key
  argument inherited -- and it is owned by `kotoba-kir`, not by this
  frontend.

  Four things are pinned here:

  1. positives per admitted value type, run to a VALUE on the KIR interpreter
     (not merely \"not refused\");
  2. the refusals, each by its exact message and code, so a program that is
     refused for a DIFFERENT reason cannot be counted as this case passing;
  3. the interaction with the keyword-keyed literal, which deliberately stays
     the legacy untagged pair map and therefore does NOT get an inferred value
     type -- it is refused by name and pointed at `typed-map-new`;
  4. a BYTE-IDENTITY control on i64-valued, keyword-keyed and
     all-unknown-value programs, whose HIR and KIR must be unchanged character
     for character. Captured on sema df383ba0 on BOTH runtimes before the
     change; `norm` exists because `pr-str` writes a `.kotoba` integer as `42`
     on the JVM and `42n` under nbb."
