  "slice-value: `[:slice T]` as a carried value, and the places it may not go.

  Two claims are checked here, and they are different claims.

  The first is that the carrier ERASES: a slice parameter becomes two i64
  parameters, a slice binding becomes two bindings, and every slice operation
  becomes one the machine already had. That is checked by reading the analysed
  HIR rather than by compiling, because the property is that no slice survives
  analysis -- a byte-level check would say the object is fine without saying
  the type is gone.

  The second is that a slice cannot reach a position two words cannot cross.
  Each of those is a distinct refusal with its own `:kotoba.error/` code, and
  every one is pinned by code AND by message here: a refusal that fires for a
  different reason than the one it names would otherwise count as a pass."
