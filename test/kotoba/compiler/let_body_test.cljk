(ns kotoba.compiler.let-body-test
  "A `let` body is an implicit `do`: every form runs, in order, and the last
  one is the value.

  Until 2026-09-02 it was neither. `desugar-expr` emitted every body form onto
  a head that takes one, `rewrite-record-projection` then rebuilt the form from
  the FIRST body form alone, and `validate-expr`'s own one-result-expression
  check measured the truncated form and passed it. So

      (let [x (f)] (store! a x) (+ x 1))

  compiled with `:ok true`, kept `(store! a x)`, and threw the value away --
  measured on the QWEN-RUNTIME cursor, where the dropped form carried the high
  word of a 64-bit offset.

  The tests here are the two halves of that: the VALUE is the last form (a
  truncating compiler answers the first one), and an earlier EFFECT survives (a
  compiler that sequenced by nesting `let`s would make it an unused binding and
  be entitled to drop it)."
