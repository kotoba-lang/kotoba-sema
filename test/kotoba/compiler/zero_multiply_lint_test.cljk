(ns kotoba.compiler.zero-multiply-lint-test
  "`kotoba.sema/lint` reports, without refusing, a call sequenced through
  arithmetic: `(+ v (* 0 (call)))` or a bare `(* 0 (call))`. The product
  keeps the call and drops its value, which is exactly what a program that
  wants the effect and not the result means -- aiueos writes it deliberately
  -- and exactly what a reader who did not write it will miss. The finding
  names the sunk call and the function it is in, in the `:code` /
  `:severity` vocabulary amu's diagnostic envelope already carries.

  Controls: multiplying a parameter by zero sinks no call; a non-zero factor
  is arithmetic; a clean program has no findings; and the program is
  admitted either way -- `lint` is a report, not a gate."
