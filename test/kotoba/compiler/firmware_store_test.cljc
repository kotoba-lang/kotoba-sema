  "fwstore: writing to pages the firmware allocated.

  A UEFI image could allocate a page and could not write it. The page is at an
  address the firmware chose, so it reaches the program through a load, and
  the region-provenance rule refuses a base that came from one -- in the
  caller as well as the callee.

  What this suite decides is that the rule is EXTENDED and not deleted.
  `(kernel-uefi-alloc-region ...)` is a third root beside `kernel-boot-info`
  and `kernel-scratch-region`; a loaded word is still refused, and so is an
  address the program computed. The page count is a literal, so this pass
  holds the region's length and refuses a window wider than it."
