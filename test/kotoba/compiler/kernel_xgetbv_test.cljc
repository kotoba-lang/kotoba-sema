(ns kotoba.compiler.kernel-xgetbv-test
  "`kernel-xgetbv` is admitted, with arity 1 and nothing else, on both runtimes.

  Arity is the WHOLE of what this frontend verifies for a privileged operation
  (`kernel-privileged-operations` is a symbol-to-count map, and
  `validate-expr`'s privileged arm checks the count and then walks the
  arguments). That makes the number here the only thing standing between a
  malformed call and a backend, and it is stated independently in three
  repositories -- here, in `kotoba-gmir`'s `x86-privileged-action-arities`, and
  in `kotoba-native`'s emitter -- with nothing keeping them equal but review.
  So it is pinned from both sides: arity 1 admits, and 0 and 2 are refused with
  the frontend's own literal message.

  What this namespace CANNOT check, and what therefore has to be said in prose:
  `xgetbv` raises #UD when CR4.OSXSAVE is clear, and the bit that reports
  CR4.OSXSAVE is `cpuid` leaf 1 ECX bit 27. A guard must test 27 before it
  reads XCR0 or feature detection faults in the middle of itself. No arity
  check can express an ordering constraint between two separate calls. See
  kotoba-native `docs/avx2-guard-sequence.md`."
