  "`match`: the authority's bounded pattern sugar, on both runtimes.

  `lang/surface-status.edn` names `match` under `:bounded-control-and-sugar`
  with `:safety {:match :single-evaluation-pure-desugar}`, `lang/guest-grammar.edn`
  lists it under `:sugar`, and the authority shipped a conformance fixture for
  it -- `lang/conformance/control/match_desugar.kotoba`. The frontend contained
  no `match` case at all, so that fixture was refused with `unbound symbol has
  no value type` (the pattern's binder), and a bare `(match n 0 100 :else 200)`
  with `operation has no admitted lowering`.

  Two of the tests below are the ones that decide whether this is pattern
  matching or a shape that merely compiles, and both fail loudly on the naive
  implementation:

  - `the-scrutinee-is-evaluated-once` counts the scrutinee's call in the
    analyzed body. Substituting the scrutinee into each arm's test puts it
    there once per arm, which is invisible until the scrutinee is a
    capability call. `:single-evaluation-pure-desugar` is the authority's
    stated safety property, not an optimization.
  - `a-map-pattern-tests-presence-not-projection` matches a key whose value
    equals the absent-key default. `map-get` answers the default for a missing
    key, so a map pattern lowered as projection alone is irrefutable: every
    `match` on a map would take its first arm."
