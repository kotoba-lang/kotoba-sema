  "When an unannotated parameter's uses disagree, the refusal names BOTH uses.

  `infer-absent-parameter-types` reads what a parameter must be from the
  checker's own refusal, refines it, and re-checks. When the refined type is
  refused on the same parameter somewhere else, the two uses cannot both hold
  -- and until now the pass put the parameter back to provisional `:i64` and
  let the ordinary checker report the FIRST site alone: `expression type
  mismatch: expected string, got i64`, with nothing saying that the i64 came
  from another use two forms away. Measured while porting aiueos
  `native/tcp_stream.kotoba`: the reader has to find the second operation
  the checker had already seen.

  The message keeps its old head (the same site, the same expected/actual, so
  a reader who pinned the prefix still finds it) and then names the parameter,
  the function, and both operations with the type each requires. The
  operations come from the call the checker was inside when it refused
  (`:kotoba.error/use-site`), not from a second walk of the body."
