(ns kotoba.compiler.host-nesting-test
  "Desugared nesting that outruns the host stack is refused in this language's
  vocabulary, not the host's.

  `check-reader-depth!` bounds nesting at `max-reader-depth` (512) — but it
  measures the SOURCE, and desugaring creates nesting the source does not
  have. A flat `(case i 0 .. 63 default)` reads at depth 2 and becomes a
  64-deep chain of `if`, which `analyze*` walks recursively.

  So the declared limit says 512 while the ClojureScript host gives out an
  order of magnitude earlier, and until 2026-08-24 it gave out in the host's
  words: a raw `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` from inside the
  compiler. The JVM reaches 128 arms and keeps going.

  These tests do NOT pin a depth. Where the host gives out is a property of
  the host and of the caller's own stack, and naming a number here would test
  the release. They pin the two things that must hold on every runtime: below
  the ceiling it analyzes, and at the ceiling the failure is ours."
