  "A declared type of the wrong SHAPE crashed the compiler instead of being
  refused.

  Measured 2026-09-03 through `amu check --jvm-free` (amu 6c245f69, which pins
  this repository at 1a073853 and kotoba-kir at b2e5d9c4):

      (let [m {3 30 1 10}]
        (option-value-of :i64 (typed-map-get :i64 m 3) 0))   exit 70

  and the whole diagnostic the CLI printed for it was

      {:code :kotoba/internal-error :severity :error :source \"p6.kotoba\"}

  -- no operation, no span, no cause. `typed-map-count` and `typed-map-contains`
  over the identical map exited 0, which made it read as a defect in
  `typed-map-get`. It is not. `typed-map-get` refuses a non-map type correctly
  (`typed map operation requires [:map key-type value-type]`). What crashed is
  `option-value-of`: its lowering read `(second (first args))` off the declared
  type without checking the shape first, and `(second :i64)` is a host error.

  Three things are pinned here.

  1. The SHAPE of the defect, not the instance. Six lowering branches
     destructured a declared type unguarded (`option-some-of`,
     `option-value-of`, `result-ok-of`, `result-err-of`, `result-value-of`,
     `result-error-of`), three read a record's field list the same way
     (`record`, `record-new`, `record-assoc`), and `validate-value-type!`
     HASHED the type to test set membership, which a `.kotoba` integer
     literal -- a JS bigint under nbb -- cannot survive. The sweep at the end
     of this file is the evidence floor: every operation that takes a declared
     type, against every wrong shape, with a count that must not be zero.

  2. The internal-error path. A host error that escapes a pass is now
     re-raised naming the operation it escaped from, and the operation reaches
     the CLI in the one field the envelope copies -- the `:kotoba.error/code`.

  3. The VALUE the well-formed program computes. `no longer exit 70` would
     pass for a compiler that had merely learned to refuse it."
