  "memwidth: every transfer width and window tier the frontend admits, and the
  provenance rule they inherit by being in the same table.

  The point of widening `kernel-memory-operations` rather than adding a second
  family beside it is that `kernel-memory-op?` reads that map: a new width gets
  the taint analysis on its first argument without a line being written for it.
  This namespace says so out loud -- if a width were added to the arity table
  while the provenance walk kept its own list,
  `a-new-width-inherits-the-provenance-rule` would fail while everything else
  stayed green."
