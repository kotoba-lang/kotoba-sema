  "A call that cannot be admitted says WHICH of three causes refused it.

  `operation has no admitted lowering` (validate-expr) and `operation has no
  admitted type signature` (inference) were one catch-all over three different
  facts, and each family's arity check said `<family> operation arity mismatch`
  without the head or the count. Measured while porting aiueos
  `native/tcp_stream.kotoba`: the same sentence for a misspelt head, for a
  head the grammar declares and this analyser has not implemented, and -- one
  family over -- an arity slip that named neither the head nor the arity it
  wanted.

  Three messages now, each naming its cause:

    unknown head      unknown operation: <op> is not a builtin, a sugar head,
                      or a function of this module[; nearest defined: ...]
    wrong arity       <family> arity mismatch: <op> takes N arguments; got M
    grammar-declared  <op> is named by the language grammar
    but unlowered     (lang/guest-grammar.edn) but this analyser has no
                      lowering for it -- not implemented on this compile path

  The third is only distinguishable where the grammar resource can be read
  (the JVM); `grammar_declared_head_test.clj` holds it. On ClojureScript such a
  head answers as unknown, which is what the runtime can honestly say.
  Nothing here changes what is admitted: every program below was refused
  before, with a sentence that did not say why."
