(ns kotoba.compiler.collection-heads-test
  "`count` had no desugar arm at all, and `first`/`second`/`rest` refused every
  collection with a message about i64.

  `lang/guest-grammar.edn` has carried

    :count {:desugars-to \"bounded pair-chain walk\" :level \"L2\"
            :backends #{:compiler :kotoba-wasm :kotoba-cljs}}

  since the head was declared, and `lang/surface-status.edn`
  `:persistent-collection-semantics` claims `:operations #{count nth peek pop
  keys vals get assoc dissoc conj disj contains?}` on the same three backends.
  Measured 2026-09-03 against sema `df383ba0` and amu `57ba0ee0`, BEFORE this
  change:

    (count [7 8 9])   operation has no admitted lowering
    (count #{:a})     operation has no admitted lowering
    (first [7 8 9])   expression type mismatch: expected i64, got vector-i64

  The two refusals are the same gap wearing different faces, and the second is
  worse: `no admitted lowering` at least names the operation, while `expected
  i64` reads as a defect in the caller's program -- the reader is told their
  vector is the wrong type for an operation whose Clojure meaning it satisfies
  exactly. `vector-count`, `vector-f64-count`, `hetero-vector-count`,
  `typed-set-count`, `typed-map-count`, `vector-at` and `vector-drop` all sat
  next to these heads, already lowered, already returning the right types.
  Nothing was missing but the dispatch. It is the defect `contains?`,
  `dissoc`, `conj` and `disj` had earlier the same day.

  What is pinned here:

  1. positives, run to a VALUE on the KIR interpreter -- not merely admitted;
  2. the REASON each refusal is raised, by its stable code, so a program that
     fails for some other cause cannot be counted as this arm discriminating
     (ADR-2608136000 question 6);
  3. both directions for every arm -- each says yes on one receiver and no on
     another;
  4. `count` is now RESERVED, and the heads that gained no implementation are
     deliberately NOT reserved: taking a name away without implementing it is
     a regression, not a protection;
  5. the parameter-inference control. A rewrite alone was not enough: parameter
     inference runs BEFORE `rewrite-record-projections` and reads a refused
     operand's required type out of the refusal's ex-data, so a head with only
     a rewrite was still refused during that earlier pass and its
     `:kotoba.error/expected :i64` was attributed to an unrelated synthesized
     parameter. That is why these heads gained a type signature as well;
  6. the byte-identity control: the pair accessors over an actual pair chain
     lower exactly as before, because that is the closure, lazy-cell, cursor
     and destructuring vocabulary of the whole desugarer."
