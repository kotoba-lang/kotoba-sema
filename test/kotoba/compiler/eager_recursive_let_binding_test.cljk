(ns kotoba.compiler.eager-recursive-let-binding-test
  "A `let` binding that calls the function being defined and is needed only
  under a later `if` branch is refused, naming the binding, the call, the
  branch, and the form that fixes it.

  Measured while porting aiueos `os/aiueos/native/tcp_stream.kotoba`: `next-run`
  was bound to the next poll step above the `if` that decided whether to poll
  again. `let` is strict, so the recursion ran on every path -- past the base
  case that branch existed to guard -- and the fix was to call a helper inside
  the branch. The checker had every fact in hand and said nothing.

  Controls: a binding the test needs, one both branches need, one whose call
  is not recursive, and the fixed form all compile. Only the guarded
  recursion is this shape."
