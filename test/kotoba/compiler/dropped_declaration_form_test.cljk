(ns kotoba.compiler.dropped-declaration-form-test
  "The dual of the crash sweep: a declaration form that COMPILES and is then
  silently dropped.

  `malformed-definition-form-test` closed the case where a malformed
  declaration reached a host error. This file closes the other end of the same
  layer -- the shapes that were ADMITTED, emitted nothing, and left the caller
  with a program that compiled without the thing they wrote.

  Measured 2026-09-03 through `amu check --jvm-free` (amu 57ba0ee0) and
  directly against this repository at 5917518b:

      (extend-type)      exit 0   admitted, declaration dropped
      (extend-type nil)  exit 0   admitted, declaration dropped
      (extend-type 42)   exit 0   admitted, declaration dropped
      (defprotocol)      exit 65  refused
      (defrecord)        exit 65  refused
      (extend-protocol)  exit 65  refused
      (definterface)     exit 65  refused -- IN defprotocol's NAME

  Two defects, and one line that had to be drawn before either could be fixed.

  1. `extend-type` was the only sibling in its family that admitted. The arm
     read `(let [[_ record-name & extra] form] ...)` and fed `extra` to
     `protocol-extension-groups`, whose loop returns `[]` on an empty
     remainder; `mapcat` over no groups called nothing, and NOTHING ELSE in
     the arm looked at `record-name`. The whole-source pass then removed the
     form along with the well-formed declarations. `extend-protocol` states
     the same requirement up front and refuses; `extend-type` now says the
     mirror of that sentence.

  2. `definterface` shares `protocol-form->info` with `defprotocol` and
     inherited its name, so a caller who wrote `definterface` was told about
     `defprotocol` -- a message that sends them to a form they did not write.
     The head is now spelled from the form. That is safe for the same reason
     `definition-heads` is a closed vocabulary: a form reaches this function
     only because the caller MATCHED its head against one of two literals.

  3. THE LINE. `dropped` is not `emitted nothing here`. An unreferenced `def`
     constant and an uncalled `defdesugar` template also leave the HIR
     unchanged, and both are correct: reference one and the HIR moves. The
     defect is a shape that is inert in EVERY program -- and measuring that
     is what stopped this change from being much larger.

     A blanket `a template body may not contain a declaration` would have
     been wrong. Measured the same day: `def`, `defrecord`, `defprotocol`,
     `definterface`, `extend-type`, `extend-protocol`, `defdesugar`,
     `defmulti` and `defmethod` are NOT in `reserved-function-names`, so
     `(defn defrecord [x] (+ x 1))` is an admitted program and
     `(defdesugar t [y] (defrecord y))` is an admitted CALL to it that
     computes. Refusing those would have broken working source to close a
     hole they were not in.

     What is left is the intersection of the two vocabularies this layer
     already has: `definition-heads` INTERSECT `reserved-function-names` =
     `#{ns defn defn-}`. A template body holding one of those three can never
     be a call, because the name may not be defined, and can never be a
     declaration, because a template body is substituted into an expression
     position. Inert in every program, so refused. The nine that may be calls
     are asserted to STILL COMPUTE, in the same file."
