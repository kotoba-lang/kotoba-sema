(ns kotoba.compiler.protocol-docstring-test
  "A protocol declaration may carry documentation.

  `ns` and `defn` both admit a docstring under `max-*-docstring-chars`.
  `defprotocol` and `definterface` did not: a leading string sat in the first
  METHOD position and a trailing string sat after a method's parameter
  vector, and both were measured against a shape that wants exactly
  `(name [params])`.

  Measured 2026-09-11 at 90baa17 through `amu check --jvm-free`:

      (defprotocol IP (-scan [this pattern]))                 exit 0
      (defprotocol IP \"the one operation\" (-scan [this p]))   exit 65
      (defprotocol IP (-scan [this pattern] \"method doc\"))     exit 65

  both refused with `defprotocol requires unique bounded (method [this ...])
  signatures` -- a sentence about signatures, raised by a string that is not
  one, which sends the reader to the parameter vectors.

  Why it mattered rather than merely annoyed: all four
  `:kotoba.error/protocol-declaration` findings in the Q9 wave-1 corpus came
  from ONE declaration, `datom.source/IPatternSource`, whose docstring states
  the three invariants every implementation must satisfy. The only way past
  it was to delete that text -- narrowing the component to compile it, which
  ADR-q9 forbids.

  Every test here is a pair: the documented form is admitted AND the check it
  used to be caught by still catches what it is for."
