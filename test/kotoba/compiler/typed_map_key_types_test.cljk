  "`[:map K V]` was generic in K everywhere except where a program could reach
  it.

  Measured 2026-09-02 against sema c031dd34 / amu a8e30d5b: the canonical
  `typed-map-*` operations already admitted `:i64`, `:string`, `:bool` and
  record keys, and already refused `:f32`/`:f64`. What refused ordinary
  Clojure was the FRIENDLY surface on top of them --

    {1 10}          map keys must be bounded keywords
    (assoc m 1 10)  expression type mismatch: expected map, got [:map :i64 :i64]
    (contains? m 1) operation has no admitted lowering
    (dissoc m 1)    operation has no admitted lowering

  -- and the `assoc` line is the one that says what the defect really was: it
  refuses a KEYWORD-keyed typed map too. `get` had been type-directed since
  the typed map landed; the write half had never been written, so a `[:map K
  V]` could be read through the friendly surface and not written, for every
  key type there is.

  Three things are pinned here, and the third is the one that could regress
  silently:

  1. positives per admitted key type, run to a value on the KIR interpreter;
  2. the ORDER `typed-map-entry-at` walks, per key type -- `kotoba.kir.value`
     re-sorts every map value it validates by `compare-typed-values`, so the
     order is the language's, not the emitter's, and it is signed-numeric for
     `:i64` and UTF-16 code-unit for `:string` (so \"C\" precedes \"a\");
  3. a BYTE-IDENTITY control: two keyword-keyed programs whose HIR and KIR
     must be unchanged, character for character, from before the change.
     Nothing else in this file would notice if the keyword literal quietly
     started lowering to a typed map -- every keyword case would still answer
     the same number."
