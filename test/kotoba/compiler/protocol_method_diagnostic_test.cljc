  "A protocol method refusal names its cause.

  `extension-implementations` checked five conditions in one `and` behind
  one sentence, `protocol method does not match its declaration`, and the
  sentence was wrong for the cause that occurs in the Q9 corpus. Measured
  2026-09-11 at 9b153c7 through `kotoba.sema/analyze`:

      (defrecord Sq [side] IP (area [this] (+ 1 1) (:side this)))       refused, that sentence
      (defrecord Sq [side] IP (area [this] (do (+ 1 1) (:side this))))  admitted

  The declaration matched; the body had two expressions. `defn` refuses the
  same shape as `function must contain one result expression`, so the
  protocol sentence now mirrors it. Nothing about what is ADMITTED moves --
  this is a diagnostics change, and `malformed_definition_form_test`'s
  record golden (digest of the HIR and KIR of a protocol module) is the
  byte-identity control that says so.

  One code throughout, `:kotoba.error/protocol-method`; only the sentence
  splits. Every sentence is pinned as a literal here, so folding the arms
  back into one turns exactly these assertions red and nothing else."
