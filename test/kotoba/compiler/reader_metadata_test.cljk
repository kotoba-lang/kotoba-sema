  "`^meta` reads, and `^:private` on a `defn` name means what `defn-` means.

  Measured 2026-09-11 at 8b28804 through `kotoba.sema/analyze`. The source
  reader (`kotoba.compiler.kotoba-reader/read-form`) had no arm for `^`, and
  `^` is not a delimiter, so `^:private` fell through to
  `read-symbol-or-number` and was read as the SYMBOL `^:private`. Every
  element after the head shifted by two:

      (defn ^:private h [x :i64] :i64 x)        function parameters must be a vector   :form h
      (defn ^{:private true} h [x :i64] :i64 x) function parameters must be a vector   :form {:private true}
      (def k ^:no-doc 1)                        constant must contain exactly one literal value
      (defrecord ^:no-doc Sq [side])            defrecord requires a bounded name and field vector
      (defprotocol ^:no-doc IP (area [this]))   defprotocol requires unique bounded (method [this ...]) signatures
      (defrecord Sq [^:no-doc side])            admitted -- as a TWO-field record, `^:no-doc` and `side`
      (defn- h [x :i64] :i64 x)                 admitted (the supported private spelling)

  Each refusal is a true sentence about what the reader handed over and a
  false one about the author's source.

  Two decisions this suite pins, both taken to match Clojure as measured on
  1.12 rather than as remembered:

  - metadata before a form that cannot carry it (keyword, number, string,
    nil, boolean) is REFUSED in `:phase :read`, not dropped. So the third
    probe above, `(def k ^:no-doc 1)`, is still refused -- now for the true
    reason, with the metadata on the name (`(def ^:no-doc k 1)`) admitted.
    Dropping would be worse than either: `^:private` on the wrong element
    would compile as public.
  - stacked metadata merges with the OUTERMOST (leftmost) form winning a
    shared key: `(meta '^{:a 1} ^{:a 2} x)` is `{:a 1}` on Clojure 1.12,
    because the inner form is read first and the outer map is assoc'd over
    it.

  Every admission here is paired with the check it used to trip still
  firing on what it is for, and privacy is proved by the export refusal --
  parsing `^:private` is not honouring it."
