  "`infer-closure-refinements` had no test that reached it.

  Measured 2026-09-08 on this repository: forcing the analysis to answer
  `:unknown` for every `let`-bound name — a real break of the pass's symbol
  resolution — left all 296 tests green. A pass with no test that reaches it
  is a pass whose green says nothing, so these assert the two facts it exists
  to produce: a parameter position that must carry a closure pair, and a
  result position that does.

  They are not a guard for any particular implementation of the walk. They
  are a guard for the pass still producing refinements at all."
