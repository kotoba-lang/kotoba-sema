(ns kotoba.compiler.oracle-reach-test
  "How far the constant oracle reaches must depend on the program being
  folded, not on how big the module around it is.

  Everything this compiler builds out of chained conditionals is a nested
  `if`: `cond` and `case` desugar to one, `do` desugars to nested `let`, and
  the closure `invoke` dispatcher is a LINEAR chain over every candidate
  lambda in the module. While `kotoba.kir/eval-expr` recursed into the chosen
  branch, each link of those chains cost one host frame — so adding an
  unrelated function to a module could make an unchanged `main` stop folding.

  Measured 2026-08-24 on nbb 1.5.212, before `if`/`let` became iterative in
  the interpreter: `(lazy-first (lazy-map inc (naturals 37)))` folded, and
  adding ONE unrelated function that also used `lazy-map` made the identical
  `main` exhaust the host stack. The JVM had the headroom and saw none of it.

  This lives here rather than in kotoba-kir because it needs the frontend to
  produce the dispatcher — kir does not depend on sema, and a hand-written
  deep chain in HIR is refused by an admission limit long before the
  interpreter's depth matters, so it cannot stand in for this."
