  "A loop's accumulator may be any value the frontend admits, not only an i64.

  `loop`/`recur` lowers to a synthesized recursive helper function, and that
  helper's RESULT type used to be a constant with exactly two possible values:
  `:i64`, or `:vector-i64` when the T4.5 `map`/`filter` desugarings bound
  `*loop-result-type*`. Nothing read the loop body. So the ordinary
  Clojure-shaped

      (loop [i 0 acc 0.0] (if (< i 3) (recur (+ i 1) (f64-add acc x)) acc))

  was refused with `expression type mismatch: expected f64, got i64` pointing
  at the loop's own call site -- even though the accumulator's type was already
  known, because `resolve-loop-helper-param-types` recovers it from the loop's
  inits. Only the result type did not read it.

  The rule tested here: a loop leaves through its non-`recur` tail exits, so
  the helper's result is the type those exits agree on; exits that disagree are
  refused naming both types and both exits; a `recur` argument must have the
  type of the binding it rebinds, refused naming the binding and the argument
  position.

  The controls matter as much as the positives. This pass runs on every module
  that uses `loop` -- including `map` and `filter`, which are loops -- so the
  last deftest pins what an unchanged integer program still emits: the same HIR
  format, the same function-map key order, the same results. The key order is
  not decoration: the first version of this change carried its two extra facts
  in the helper's own function map, which pushed it past the eight-entry
  array-map threshold, and every loop-using module's HIR text moved without a
  single value in it changing."
