  "boot-scratch: the writable region a UEFI image owns, and the address of a
  function in the same module.

  What this suite decides is what the frontend decides: that
  `(kernel-scratch-region)` is a provenance ROOT like `kernel-boot-info`, that
  a window declared over it is bounded by the reservation, and that
  `(kernel-function-address f)` takes a NAME -- checked against this module's
  own functions, not typed as an expression. Which TARGET may name either is
  amu's, exactly as it is for the literal heads."
