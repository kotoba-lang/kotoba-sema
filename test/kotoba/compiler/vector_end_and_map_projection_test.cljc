  "`peek`, `pop`, `keys` and `vals` -- the four heads two authorities claimed
  on three backends and nothing implemented.

  On 2026-09-03 they were measured absent and the AUTHORITY was corrected to
  stop claiming them, for a sound reason: Clojure's `peek`/`pop` on a vector
  take from the END, `vector-drop` drops from the FRONT, there was no
  `vector-pop`, and there was no `typed-map-keys`/`typed-map-vals`. The
  owner's direction the same day was the other way -- add the primitives so
  the language has the operations. kotoba-kir gained `vector-take`,
  `vector-f64-take`, `typed-list-nth`, `typed-map-keys` and `typed-map-vals`;
  this is the head half.

  Measured against sema `7d46f89e`, BEFORE this change:

    (peek [7 8 9])                     operation has no admitted lowering
    (pop [7 8 9])                      operation has no admitted lowering
    (peek (pop [7 8 9]))               operation has no admitted lowering
    (keys (typed-map-new [:map :i64 :i64] 1 10 2 20))
                                       operation has no admitted lowering
    (defn peek [a] :i64 a)             ACCEPTED

  What is pinned here:

  1. positives, run to a VALUE on the KIR interpreter -- not merely admitted;
  2. the READING, discriminated. Clojure's vector `peek` is the LAST item and
     its list `peek` is the first, and the fixture the language authority
     writes this with -- `(peek (pop [7 8 9]))` -- is 8 under BOTH readings,
     so passing it measures nothing about which one was implemented. The
     assertions here are the ones that differ: `(peek [7 8 9])` is 9 and not
     7, and `(first (pop [7 8 9]))` is 7 and not 8;
  3. the REASON each refusal is raised, by its stable code, so a program that
     fails for some other cause cannot be counted as this arm discriminating
     (ADR-2608136000 question 6);
  4. both directions for every arm;
  5. the emptiness decision, by the trap keyword a program actually meets;
  6. single evaluation of the receiver, which both readings need twice;
  7. the reservation, in both directions -- the four that gained a lowering
     are reserved, and `seq`/`last`, which no authority claims and nothing
     implements, are still names a program may define;
  8. the byte-identity control: the pair heads over an actual pair chain, and
     `nth`/`count` over a bounded vector, lower exactly as before."
