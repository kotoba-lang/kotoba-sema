  "boot-lit: the four read-only-literal spellings, and the two wider firmware
  calls.

  What this suite decides is what the frontend decides: the heads are known,
  each owns its arity, each takes a STRING LITERAL rather than an expression,
  and each malformed shape is refused where the author can see what they wrote.
  What it deliberately does NOT say is that any of them is safe on a given
  target -- the frontend admits these target-independently, exactly as it
  admits `kernel-write-cr3` for `x86_64-linux-kotoba-v1`, and amu owns the
  gate."
