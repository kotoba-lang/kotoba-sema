  "Unannotated parameters take the type their body requires, on both runtimes.

  An absent annotation used to mean `:i64`, so every function that touched a
  string had to write one -- `(defn digit [line i] (string-substring line i (+ i 1)))`
  was rejected with `expected string, got i64`, naming a constraint the
  frontend already knew and would not apply.

  The constraint is read from the checker's own refusal, not from a second
  table of operand types, so what a parameter must be is by construction
  whatever the type checker requires.

  The tests that matter are the conservative ones. This pass must not change
  the meaning of any program that was admitted before it, so: a written
  annotation is never refined, a parameter used as an i64 stays one, and a
  parameter whose uses disagree falls back to `:i64` and fails at the same
  place with the same message it failed with before."
