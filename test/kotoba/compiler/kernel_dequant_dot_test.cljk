  "dequant: the frontend's half of the fused dequantize-and-dot family.

  It inherits `kernel-dot-f32`'s shape -- two regions, base positions 0 and 2
  -- and therefore inherits the hole `kernel-base-positions` exists to close.
  Everything asserted here is asserted per FORMAT rather than once for the
  family, because the table is per-format data and dropping one row is the
  failure this namespace is for: the missing head would fall through to
  \"unknown function\", and a base in position 2 would flow past the
  provenance walk entirely."
