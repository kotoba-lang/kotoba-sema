(ns kotoba.compiler.case-uniqueness-test
  "`case` over integer constants, on both runtimes.

  ClojureScript cannot hash a JS `bigint`: `cljs.core/hash` reaches
  `goog.getUid`, which sets a property on the object, and a bigint is a
  primitive. `distinct` stays linear up to eight elements and only then
  converts to a hash set, so `desugar-case`'s uniqueness check
  `(count (distinct constants))` compiled a case with eight integer arms and
  threw `Cannot create property 'closure_uid_...' on bigint` at the ninth --
  on ClojureScript only, because a `.kotoba` integer literal is a bigint there
  and a Long on the JVM, where 64 arms were always fine.

  The visible cost was in the source people write. `aiueos/kotoba/sha256.kotoba`
  spells SHA-256's 64 round constants as a 63-deep nested `if`, which is what
  is left when `case` is not available for a constant table.

  These tests are `.cljc` on purpose: on the JVM every one of them passed
  before the fix, which is exactly why nothing noticed."
