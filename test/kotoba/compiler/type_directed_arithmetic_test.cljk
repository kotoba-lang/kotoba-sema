  "Type-directed name resolution for the plain numeric operators (2026-09-02).

  `+ - * / < <= > >= =` are one spelling each; the operand types choose the
  typed operation the way Unison resolves `+` to `Nat.+` or `Float.+`. Two
  f64 operands lower to the `f64-*` family, two f32 operands to `f32-*`, and
  i64 operands are left exactly as written -- the golden fixture below is the
  pre-change output of two integer programs, so the last claim is measured
  rather than supposed.

  There is no implicit conversion. A float next to an i64, or an f32 next to
  an f64, is rejected with a message that names both types and the explicit
  conversion operations; the message is pinned here verbatim because it is
  the thing that tells the author where to go."
