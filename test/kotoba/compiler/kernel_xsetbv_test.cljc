  "The WRITE half of a CPU feature check is admitted, at three arities and
  nothing else, on both runtimes.

  `kernel-xgetbv` (ADR 0003) reads what the operating system has agreed to save
  across a context switch. `kernel-read-cr4`, `kernel-write-cr4` and
  `kernel-xsetbv` are how an operating system AGREES: CR4 bit 18 (OSXSAVE) is
  what `xgetbv` faults without, and `xsetbv` is the only way to set the XCR0
  bits it then reports.

  Arity is the WHOLE of what this frontend verifies for a privileged operation,
  and it is stated independently in four repositories -- here, kotoba-gmir's
  `x86-privileged-action-arities`, kotoba-verifier's own re-derived table, and
  kotoba-native's emitter -- with nothing keeping them equal but review. So it
  is pinned from both sides.

  What this namespace CANNOT check, and what therefore has to be said in prose:

  - a SEQUENCE. `xsetbv` raises #UD unless CR4.OSXSAVE is already set, so a
    kernel must test `cpuid` leaf 1 ECX bit 26, set CR4 bit 18, and only then
    execute `xsetbv`. No arity check expresses an ordering between calls.
  - a VALUE. `xsetbv` raises #GP for a bit XCR0 does not define, for bit 0
    (x87) clear, and for bit 2 (YMM) set without bit 1 (SSE). `(kernel-xsetbv
    0 6)` and `(kernel-xsetbv 0 4)` have the same shape and the second faults.

  Both live in kotoba-native `docs/avx2-guard-sequence.md`."
