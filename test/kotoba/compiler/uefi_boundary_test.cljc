  "boot: the four UEFI firmware-boundary spellings.

  What this suite can say is what the frontend actually decides: the four heads
  are known, each owns its arity, and each returns i64 like the rest of the
  privileged family. What it deliberately does NOT say is that any of them is
  safe to use on a given target -- the frontend admits privileged operations
  target-independently, and amu owns the gate that refuses `kernel-load-ptr`
  outside `:x86_64-aiueos-uefi-v1`."
