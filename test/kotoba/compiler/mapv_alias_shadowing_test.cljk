(ns kotoba.compiler.mapv-alias-shadowing-test
  "`mapv` and `filterv` are surface aliases of `map` and `filter`, and neither
  is declared by the grammar authority -- not in `:sugar`, not in
  `:admitted-builtins` (measured 2026-09-06). They used to rewrite
  unconditionally, so a module that DEFINED a function called `mapv` had its
  own definition silently overridden, and the alias requires `vector-i64`
  sources where the module's function took a pair chain.

  `lang/stdlib/core.kotoba` defines exactly that. The collision made every
  function in that module uncallable through its oracle harness -- 772 errors
  in `kotoba.lang.stdlib-core-oracle-test`, all of them ONE refusal
  re-reported per assertion, because that namespace shares a single `delay`.

  Measured the same day: `mapv` was the only name where a built-in beat a user
  definition. `keep`, `remove`, `sort`, `distinct`, `interpose`, `partition`,
  `juxt2` and `frequencies` all resolved to the module's own function, and the
  identical body renamed to `mapv2` compiled and ran. So this is one
  undeclared alias claiming a name it was never given, not a shadowing policy."
