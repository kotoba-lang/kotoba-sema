  "The typed abort ability, slices 1 and 2 (kotoba-lang `lang/abort-ability.edn`).

  `lang/surface-status.edn` `:explicit-errors` bans the AMBIENT `throw`/`try`/
  `catch` under the invariant that no control effect is untracked, and names
  the widening: a typed abort whose effect appears in the inferred row. This
  is that widening, in the smallest complete shape:

  - `(throw e)` types as bottom, puts `:abort` on the enclosing function's
    inferred row, and the function's error type E is the type of `e`.
  - `(try body (catch [E] e handler))` catches every abort the body can reach
    and REMOVES `:abort` from what the body contributed.
  - Slice 2: a CALL to an aborting function makes the caller aborting too, so
    `:abort` and E are interprocedural facts; and an aborting form in an
    operand or a test is A-normalized into a `let` binding rather than
    refused, LEFT TO RIGHT, so hoisting cannot reorder two observable effects.
  - Elaboration lowers an aborting function to return `[:result T E]`, a
    throw to `result-err-of`, a try to one `result-match-of`. Nothing unwinds;
    no backend sees either head.

  Everything the slice does not do is refused with a message that says so,
  and each refusal is pinned here by its exact text. The control at the end
  is a throw-free program whose HIR and KIR hashes were taken on the commit
  before this ability existed (kotoba-sema c14ca39e): a change to how any
  throw-free program lowers would move them."
