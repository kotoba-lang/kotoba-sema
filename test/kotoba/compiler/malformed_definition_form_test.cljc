(ns kotoba.compiler.malformed-definition-form-test
  "A top-level `defn` whose NAME position held something that is not a symbol
  crashed the compiler instead of being refused.

  Measured 2026-09-03 through `amu check --jvm-free` (amu 57ba0ee0) and
  directly against this repository at 0a5dcc2:

      (defn)            exit 70   internal compiler error
      (defn main)       exit 65   function parameters must be a vector
      (defn nil [] 0)   exit 70   internal compiler error
      (defn 42 [] 0)    exit 70   internal compiler error
      (defn main [] 0)  exit 0

  The host exception behind the 70s was `Doesn't support name: 42` -- a raw
  error with no `ex-data` at all, which the CLI can only report as
  `{:code :kotoba/internal-error :severity :error}`: no operation, no span, no
  cause. `expand-defn-parts` called `(name source-name)` before anything
  checked what sat there, and `name` is defined on a symbol, a keyword and a
  string and nothing else.

  Three things are pinned here.

  1. The SHAPE of the defect, not the instance. Fifteen spellings reached that
     one call: nil (from `(defn)` and from a literal `nil`), an integer, a
     float, a boolean, a vector, a map, a set and a list, each under `defn`
     and `defn-`, plus the multi-arity forms. The sweep at the end is the
     evidence floor -- every definition head the grammar admits, against every
     malformed shape, with a count that must not be zero.

     Two spellings did NOT crash: `(defn \"f\" [] 0)` and `(defn :f [] 0)`,
     only because `name` happens to accept a string and a keyword. They were
     refused two hundred lines later with `invalid function name`. One arity of
     the same declaration was guarded and the others were not, which is the
     same shape as the `option-value-of` crash fixed earlier the same day.

  2. That the refusal reuses that sibling's sentence. `invalid function name`
     is the fact for every non-symbol in the name position; a second phrasing
     would only mean the compiler knew two things where there is one. It is
     raised on the FORM, so the span points somewhere the reader can act --
     `nil`, `42` and `{}` carry no reader metadata of their own.

  3. The internal-error naming, extended to this layer. `internal-failure!`
     sits at three per-EXPRESSION chokepoints, all of which run after the
     definition layer, so nothing named these. `definition-failure!` is the
     backstop for the host error nobody has measured yet: it keeps exit 70,
     because a compiler that broke is not a caller who typed something wrong,
     and adds WHICH declaration it broke reading.

  And the control that says the change refuses only what was already wrong:
  two correct declaration-dense programs whose HIR and KIR digests are the
  ones measured before the fix."
