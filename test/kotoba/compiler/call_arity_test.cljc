  "A wrong argument count is refused, in BOTH directions.

  Until 2026-09-02 only one direction was guarded. Measured on this repo at
  fd68866:

      (defn- two [a b] (+ a b))
      (defn run [] :i64 (two 1 2 3))

  compiled with `:ok true` and ANSWERED 3. `(two 1)` was correctly refused
  with `function call arity mismatch`, so the check existed and read as
  complete; what it never saw was the three-argument form. A caller who adds
  an argument got a different answer rather than a refusal, and nothing in the
  output said a check had not run.

  The drop was in `elaborate-named-ability`, whose call branch walked
  arguments with `(map f args expected-arg-types)` -- two-collection `map`
  stops at the SHORTER one, so the surplus argument was neither elaborated nor
  carried forward. `validate-expr`'s own `function call arity mismatch` then
  measured the already-shortened form and passed it. Same shape as the `let`
  body truncation (`let-body-test`) and the `if` arity truncation
  (`if-parts`): a pass rebuilds a form from a destructuring that cannot
  express the surplus, and the checker downstream measures the rebuilt form.

  Every case below is one positive and one negative. The negatives pin the
  exact message, because a refusal that stops naming what it refused is how
  the next truncation gets read as a scoping rule."
